Lean Admin Migration Notes
==========================

Goal: keep only the control surfaces required for the new architecture (ticker whitelist, signals oversight, engine/portfolio metrics). Everything else remains in the repo temporarily but is hidden from navigation and blocked by middleware.

Hidden / legacy routes (redirected to `/admin`):
- `/admin/users`
- `/admin/subscriptions`
- `/admin/revenue`
- `/admin/ai-tokens`
- `/admin/data-costs`
- `/admin/engine-allocation`
- `/admin/smc-engine`
- `/admin/early-access`
- `/admin/contact-requests`
- `/admin/discord`
- `/admin/crashes`
- `/admin/errors`
- `/admin/push`
- `/admin/content`
- `/admin/settings`
- `/admin/performance`

Follow-up cleanup:
1. Once we confirm no other jobs depend on `engine_universe`, `engine_allocation_symbol_allowlist`, or `ticker_engine_owner` overrides, delete the related UI directories and Supabase tables.
2. After marketing/lead tooling is rebuilt elsewhere, remove the `early-access` and `contact-requests` code paths entirely.
3. Replace ALLOWED_EMAILS guards with role-based checks so we no longer need hard-coded email lists in the API routes.
